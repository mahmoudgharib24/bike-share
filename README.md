# bike-share
my first repository on github 
# My-Udacity-Bikeshare-Project
## Introduction
This Python script is written for Project 2 (Term 1) of Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Dataset
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of Data Science Nanodegree Program
